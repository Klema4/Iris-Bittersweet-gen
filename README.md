# Iris Bittersweet gen
I always wanted to make my very own world generator that could have anything I need and wanted all the time.

**THIS GEN IS NOT A GOOD IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT, DO NOT USE IT.**

# Things I need to learn before going into full production:
- [X] Learn and understand dimensions
- [X] Do some biomes for orienting in Iris
- [X] Make some structures to know how to add that too
- [ ] Making caves

- [ ] Completing whole list - knowing basics/advances of Iris

# I do not solve any issues and pull requests right now.
If you want to make a contribution, you can message me on my Discord `Kl√©ma#2512` (not recommended rn, I will update README soon)

# Biomes I want to make
- [ ] Spruce lands
- [ ] Birch flat
- [ ] Oak woods

Many more will be added soon. I just don't know what to add and how to name it properly...
